                By now, you’ve probably seen the ads and heard people talking
                about collagen protein—it’s everywhere. But what’s all the buzz
                about? Is it time for you to jump on the bandwagon? And if
                you’ve already joined the masses, why should you make the switch
                to Ageless Multi-Collagen Protein Powder?
              </p>
              <p class="py-4">
                In order to answer these questions, we first have to answer this
                one: <b>What is collagen?</b>
              </p>
              <p class="py-4">
                Simply put, collagen is the most abundant and arguably the most
                important protein in the body. In fact, collagen constitutes a
                whopping 30% of the protein in your body. Aside from water,
                <b>collagen is the most plentiful substance in your body</b>
                —pretty crazy, right?
              </p>
              <p class="py-4">
                For example, collagen makes up 70% of the protein in our skin,
                and it’s one of the primary structural proteins in joints,
                bones, cartilage, ligaments, tendons, hair, fingernails, the
                intestinal wall, and more. Collagen is the glue—literally, it
                comes from the Greek word for glue—that supports, connects, and
                holds everything together.
              </p>
              <p class="py-4">
                Not surprisingly, healthy levels of collagen are vital to
                support:
              </p>
              <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
                <li>Smooth, healthy, young-looking skin</li>
                <li>Strong, healthy fingernails and glossy hair</li>
                <li>Healthy, supple joints</li>
                <li>Bone health</li>
                <li>Healthy digestion and gut health</li>
                <li>Strong, healthy tendons and ligaments</li>
              </ul>
              <p class="py-4">
                There’s more—including healthy, flexible blood vessels and organ
                health—but the moral of the story is that collagen is a
                component of your entire body, and it has a tremendous impact on
                how you look and feel.
              </p>
              <h1 class="text-2xl">Why Do You Need a Collagen Powder?</h1>
              <p class="py-4">
                When you’re young, your body makes all the collagen it needs.
                That’s why your skin is firm and glowing, your joints are
                supple, and your digestive system works like a champ.
              </p>
              <p class="py-4">
                So, what happens as you get older? Your body loses its ability
                to make collagen, and to make matters worse, collagen might
                reduce more rapidly thanks to things like smoking, stress,
                excess sun exposure, physical activity, and diet. For example,
                consuming sugar, refined carbs, and poor-quality fats (such as
                industrial produced vegetable oils), which are common in
                processed foods, can all contribute to collagen depletion.
              </p>
              <b class="py-4"
                >In simple terms, we produce less collagen with age.</b
              >
              <p class="py-4">
                For example, studies show that skin levels of collagen decrease
                by about 11 – 13% with each passing decade after the age of 20,
                and by the time folks hit their 80s, collagen levels may be, on
                average, only one-third of what they were in their 20s.

                That may sound grim, but it’s not all bad news. In fact, there’s
                GREAT news.
                <b>
                  You can ramp up your body’s collagen production by consuming
                  more collagen protein in your diet.

              </p>
              <p class="py-4">
                Collagen protein is very different from other common protein
                sources—such as beef, poultry, fish, eggs, dairy, and
                plants—because it features a unique profile of amino acids, and
                it is especially rich in glycine, proline, and hydroxyproline,
                which is found ONLY in collagen protein. Together, these three
                amino acids account for 40 – 50% of the amino acids in collagen
                protein, which is 10 – 20 times higher than other common protein
                sources.
              </p>
              <p class="py-4">
                Why is that important? These are the raw materials the body
                needs to support collagen production and support healthy levels
                of collagen. Even more, research shows that consuming a very
                specific type of collagen protein—known as collagen
                peptides—trigger the body to make more collagen and produce more
                hyaluronic acid, which is a lubricating fluid that’s a key
                component of healthy, hydrated skin and healthy, supple
                joints.Footnote†

                Well, just like us, collagen is the primary structural protein
                in animals. You’ll find it in their connective tissue, including
                skin, bones, and cartilage. Unfortunately, we’ve all but
                abandoned the traditional “nose to tail” way of eating.
              </p>
              <p class="py-4">
                Most of us eat boneless, skinless muscle meat, which provides
                protein that’s quite a bit different than collagen protein,
                which has a very specific combination of amino acids and
                functional properties. We rarely eat bone-in meat, let alone the
                skin, organ meats, and other connective tissue from land and sea
                creatures.
              </p>
              <p class="py-4">
                And while bone broth can be a great source of collagen protein,
                making homemade bone broth takes time to make and clean up—a lot
                of time. The good news is that you can buy pre-made bone broth
                that’s pretty darn tasty. However, that can become an expensive
                habit quite quickly, and let’s face it, most people aren’t
                interested in sipping a cup of bone broth every single day,
                which you’d need to do to continuously support healthy levels of
                collagen.

                In order to answer these questions, we first have to answer this
                one: <b>What is collagen?</b>
              </p>
              <p class="py-4">
                Simply put, collagen is the most abundant and arguably the most
                important protein in the body. In fact, collagen constitutes a
                whopping 30% of the protein in your body. Aside from water,
                <b>collagen is the most plentiful substance in your body</b>

              </p>
              <p class="py-4">
                For example, collagen makes up 70% of the protein in our skin,
                and it’s one of the primary structural proteins in joints,
                bones, cartilage, ligaments, tendons, hair, fingernails, the
                intestinal wall, and more. Collagen is the glue—literally, it
                comes from the Greek word for glue—that supports, connects, and
                holds everything together.
              </p>
              <p class="py-4">
                Not surprisingly, healthy levels of collagen are vital to
                support:

                There’s more—including healthy, flexible blood vessels and organ
                health—but the moral of the story is that collagen is a
                component of your entire body, and it has a tremendous impact on
                how you look and feel.

              <h1 class="text-2xl">Why Do You Need a Collagen Powder?</h1>
              <p class="py-4">
                When you’re young, your body makes all the collagen it needs.
                That’s why your skin is firm and glowing, your joints are
                supple, and your digestive system works like a champ.
              </p>
              <p class="py-4">
                So, what happens as you get older? Your body loses its ability
                to make collagen, and to make matters worse, collagen might
                reduce more rapidly thanks to things like smoking, stress,
                excess sun exposure, physical activity, and diet. For example,
                consuming sugar, refined carbs, and poor-quality fats (such as
                industrial produced vegetable oils), which are common in
                processed foods, can all contribute to collagen depletion.

              >
              <p class="py-4">
                For example, studies show that skin levels of collagen decrease
                by about 11 – 13% with each passing decade after the age of 20,
                and by the time folks hit their 80s, collagen levels may be, on
                average, only one-third of what they were in their 20s.

                  For example, collagen makes up 70% of the protein in our skin,

                <p class="py-4">
                  When you’re young, your body makes all the collagen it needs.
                  That’s why your skin is firm and glowing, your joints are
                  supple, and your digestive system works like a champ.

                  So, what happens as you get older? Your body loses its ability
                  to make collagen, and to make matters worse, collagen might
                  reduce more rapidly thanks to things like smoking, stress,
                  excess sun exposure, physical activity, and diet. For example,
                  consuming sugar, refined carbs, and poor-quality fats (such as
                  industrial produced vegetable oils), which are common in
                  processed foods, can all contribute to collagen depletion.

                  Simply put, collagen is the most abundant and arguably the

                  For example, collagen makes up 70% of the protein in our skin,

                  bones, cartilage, ligaments, tendons, hair, fingernails, the
                  intestinal wall, and more. Collagen is the glue—literally, it

                  When you’re young, your body makes all the collagen it needs.

                  So, what happens as you get older? Your body loses its ability

                  reduce more rapidly thanks to things like smoking, stress,
                  excess sun exposure, physical activity, and diet. For example,
                  consuming sugar, refined carbs, and poor-quality fats (such as
                  industrial produced vegetable oils), which are common in
                  processed foods, can all contribute to collagen depletion.

                  Well, just like us, collagen is the primary structural protein
                  in animals. You’ll find it in their connective tissue,
                  including skin, bones, and cartilage. Unfortunately, we’ve all
                  but abandoned the traditional “nose to tail” way of eating.

                  Most of us eat boneless, skinless muscle meat, which provides
                  protein that’s quite a bit different than collagen protein,
                  which has a very specific combination of amino acids and
                  functional properties. We rarely eat bone-in meat, let alone
                  the skin, organ meats, and other connective tissue from land
                  and sea creatures.

                  And while bone broth can be a great source of collagen
                  protein, making homemade bone broth takes time to make and
                  clean up—a lot of time. The good news is that you can buy
                  pre-made bone broth that’s pretty darn tasty. However, that
                  can become an expensive habit quite quickly, and let’s face

                  which has a very specific combination of amino acids and
                  functional properties. We rarely eat bone-in meat, let alone
                  the skin, organ meats, and other connective tissue from land
                  and sea creatures.
                </p>
                <p class="py-4">
                  And while bone broth can be a great source of collagen
                  protein, making homemade bone broth takes time to make and
                  clean up—a lot of time. The good news is that you can buy
                  pre-made bone broth that’s pretty darn tasty. However, that
                  can become an expensive habit quite quickly, and let’s face
                  it, most people aren’t interested in sipping a cup of bone
                  broth every single day, which you’d need to do to continuously
                  support healthy levels of collagen.
